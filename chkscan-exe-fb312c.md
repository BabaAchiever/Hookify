ChkScan.exe is an executable file associated with Tiny Personal Firewall, a security software developed by Tiny Software, specifically version 6.0.1.11. This file is generally considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware; however, like any executable, it can be targeted by malicious programs that may disguise themselves under the same name. Users may encounter errors related to ChkScan.exe if the Tiny Personal Firewall is not properly installed or if there are issues with system configurations. It is advisable to ensure that the software is up-to-date and to perform regular scans with a reputable antivirus program to rule out any potential threats.
